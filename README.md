# My Lifeguard Rotation

As a part time lifeguard and a software engineer, I have decided to challenge myself by recreating my aquatic center's diagram. This diagram is designed to inform lifeguards when to be on guard and when they will be on break! This method is typically written on a whiteboard, but I want to be innovative and design a much better diagram to make it visually appealing and understandable!
